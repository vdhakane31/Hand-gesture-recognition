# ML Hand Gesture Recognition System ✋🤖

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **hand gesture recognition system** that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from images and real-time video data. The system enables **intuitive human–computer interaction** by allowing users to control applications through simple hand gestures.

The project uses **computer vision** and **machine learning techniques** to process hand images captured via a webcam and classify gestures such as **Palm, Fist, Thumb Up, and Down** in real time.

## 🎯 Objective
To design and implement a real-time **hand gesture recognition model** that enables natural, gesture-based control systems using image processing and machine learning.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – Image processing & webcam handling  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning (SVM classifier)  
- **Scikit-image** – Feature extraction (HOG)  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Tkinter** – Graphical User Interface (GUI)  
- **Joblib** – Model saving and loading

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Captured hand gesture images using a webcam.
2. Preprocessed images by resizing and converting them to grayscale.
3. Extracted features using **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**.
4. Trained a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier on labeled gesture data.
5. Integrated the trained model with a real-time webcam feed.
6. Displayed predictions through a user-friendly GUI.
